# Root Routing Configuration for Channels.
# It is similar to a Django URLconf in that it tells Channels
# what code to run
# when an HTTP request is received by the Channels server.

# AuthMiddlewareStack populates the connectionâ€™s scope
# with a reference to the currently authenticated user.
# URLRouter examines the HTTP path of the connection
# to route it to a particular consumer
